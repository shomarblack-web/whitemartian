# White Martian — Watchtower (Web Edition)

## New: Seating Arrangement

Built and tested end-to-end (backend logic, then confirmed live through
real browser sessions). Models the physical circle of chairs the game
was designed around, with Watchtower (the host) sitting outside it.

- **Seats assigned during Shuffle** — same button as character shuffle,
  per your call. Seat count always matches the number of registered
  players (confirmed it grows/reseats if that count changes) and stays
  fixed on later reshuffles (confirmed characters can redeal without
  moving anyone's seat).
- **Circular diagram** for both host and player, each seat showing the
  first two letters of the player's name. Player's own view highlights
  their own seat in gold.
- **The Flash's "Fastest Man Alive"** actually swaps seats now (previously
  he was miscategorized as a generic shield-filler, which didn't match
  his card at all — fixed). The swap is announced publicly to every
  player and the host, by design — it's meant to be a visible tell.
- **Green Lantern's "Green Lantern's Light"** silently shields his two
  seat-neighbors when Eliminate phase ends, with zero immediate
  notification — confirmed they only find out via a delayed alert at the
  start of the following Report phase, exactly as described.
- **Plastic Man's "Group Hug"** lets him pick Left or Right; the two
  players in that direction get shielded with no notification at all,
  ever — confirmed directly.

**Also corrected**: Green Lantern and Plastic Man were both in the
generic "fills a protection dot" shield system too, which didn't match
either of their actual card text. Removed both, since they now have
their own bespoke mechanics above.

## New: Arrested! condition (Citizen's Arrest / Forget the Rules)

Built and tested end-to-end across a real round transition. Host sends a
prompt (Inspect! phase only) for James Gordon, Maggie Sawyer, Robin, or
Batgirl; their player privately picks any active player; the target gets
an immediate "Arrested!" alert, then a phase-specific reminder each time
a restricted phase comes up next round, and the restriction auto-clears
once that round passes.

**Found and fixed a real bug along the way**: Robin and Batgirl's
"Forget the Rules" ability wasn't tagged for Inspect! at all — its card
text said "During Inspect! phase" instead of the standard trailing
"(Inspect!)" every other ability uses, so my auto-tagger never picked it
up and the Send Arrest Prompt button silently did nothing for them.
Fixed by adding the standard tag to the end of the ability text.

**These two abilities aren't actually the same restriction**, despite
looking similar:
- James Gordon / Maggie Sawyer's **Citizen's Arrest** blocks Discuss,
  Vote, and Accuse specifically — matches your example exactly.
- Robin / Batgirl's **Forget the Rules** is broader — it blocks *every*
  ability the target has, confirmed via a live test that their normal
  phase reminder came back empty during the restricted round.

Also confirmed: since Inspect is the last phase in the round order, the
restriction applies to the *next* round's phases (this round's have
already happened) — flagged in case that's not what you intended.

## New: four character-specific mechanics

All four built and tested end-to-end against a live server (real
Socket.IO clients, not just unit tests):

**1. Lobo's personal tracker** — a 3-counter widget (Civilians / Heroes /
Martians exposed) on his card, both host and player-facing. Host has
+/- buttons; hitting a combined total of 3 triggers "LOBO WINS!"
immediately. **Flagged discrepancy**: you described the categories as
Civilian/Hero/**Villain**, but his actual card text says Civilian/Hero/
**Martian** — I built it to match the real card text. Let me know if you
want it changed to Villain instead.

**2. Parasite's Absorption** — host sends him a prompt (Accuse! phase
only); his player privately sees every currently-Exposed player and picks
one. His card then shows his own 2 abilities plus a "— Absorbed from
X —" divider followed by that character's full ability list, replacing
any previous absorption. Confirmed only one absorption is ever active at
a time, and the divider doesn't break the ability-text parser (learned
that lesson from an earlier bug — prepending text to an ability would
have broken the bold-title parsing, so absorbed abilities are appended
as their own untouched entries instead).

**3. Dr. Alchemy's Alchemy Stone** — host sends him a prompt (Inspect!
phase only); his player picks any active player, then chooses Protector
or Eliminator for them. Protector grants a real shield (plugs directly
into the existing Protect-phase wizard — confirmed the target becomes
selectable there immediately). Eliminator grants real Eliminate-phase
voting rights alongside the White Martians (confirmed they can vote,
and — matching how Martians don't target each other — they're excluded
from being voted off themselves once granted this).

**4. Grodd's Mind Scramble** — a "Mind Scramble x2" button on his row
(Round 3+ only, matching the Super Ability unlock rule) that runs the
existing Shuffle logic twice in a row, excluding Grodd himself both
times. Confirmed with a fixed random seed that real reassignment happens
and Grodd never moves.

## New: Host phase checklists

Added to the existing phase-script popup (which already auto-opens and
shows the narration line + gold spotlight glow): a **Host Checklist**
section with clickable checkboxes for each phase, sharing the same
underlying rules content as the player tutorial guides — just phrased as
action items for you instead of "what to expect" for players. Checking
items off doesn't reset when the popup's live content updates (e.g. Vote's
tally refreshing as votes come in) — verified this holds even mid-vote.

This also filled a real gap: **Eliminate!, Protect!, and Inspect! never
had a phase-script popup at all before** — clicking those phase LEDs did
nothing beyond the spotlight glow. They now get the "[Hero], open your
eyes..." line (for Protect/Inspect) and a full checklist (all three),
matching the other five phases.

A live, multi-device rebuild of your Tkinter game tracker. One host device runs
the console; players follow along and vote from their phones on the same WiFi.

## Two ways to run this

1. **On your laptop** (what you've been doing) — free, no setup, but your
   laptop has to stay on and everyone needs the same WiFi.
2. **On the internet** (new, below) — free, works for players anywhere, but
   takes about 15 minutes of one-time setup and has a couple of trade-offs
   (see "Things to know" below).

## Running it on your laptop

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The terminal will print two links:
- **Host console** — open on the moderator's laptop: `http://localhost:5000/host`
- **Player view** — share the printed LAN address with players' phones, e.g.
  `http://192.168.1.23:5000/play` (must be on the same WiFi network)

## Hosting it on the internet (Render, free)

This lets players join from anywhere — different houses, different cities —
using a real web link instead of your laptop's WiFi address. No credit card
needed. Takes about 15 minutes the first time.

**1. Put the code on GitHub**
- Create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't
  have one.
- Click **New repository**, name it something like `watchtower-web`, leave
  it Public, and click **Create repository**.
- On the next page, click **uploading an existing file**, then drag your
  entire unzipped `watchtower_web` folder into the browser window (modern
  browsers preserve the subfolders like `static/` and `templates/`
  automatically). Click **Commit changes**.

**2. Deploy it on Render**
- Create a free account at [render.com](https://render.com) (no card
  required) and connect your GitHub account when prompted.
- Click **New +** → **Blueprint**, and pick the repo you just created.
  Render will read the included `render.yaml` and configure everything
  automatically — you shouldn't need to type in any settings.
- Click **Apply** / **Create**. The first deploy takes a few minutes.

**3. Get your links**
- Once it says "Live," Render gives you a URL like
  `https://white-martian-watchtower.onrender.com`.
- Host console: that URL + `/host`
- Player link: that URL + `/play` — send this to players wherever they are.

### Things to know about the free hosted version

- **It falls asleep when nobody's used it for ~15 minutes**, and takes
  30-60 seconds to wake back up on the next visit. Fine between game
  sessions; just give it a minute if the first load feels stuck.
- **All game state lives in memory, not a database.** If the service
  restarts or spins down (long idle gap, a redeploy, etc.), the round,
  roster, and all assignments reset — same as restarting `python app.py`
  locally. Avoid multi-hour breaks mid-game on the hosted version.
- If you ever want zero sleep/reset risk, Render's paid tier (~$7/month)
  keeps it running continuously — same code, no changes needed, just
  switch the plan in Render's dashboard.

## How it's built (and why it's much smaller than 23,000 lines)

The original app hand-wrote a near-identical set of functions for every one of
its ~90 characters (activate, deactivate, rescue, etc. — 942 functions total).
That duplication was also the source of the bugs found during review (a shared
toggle counter across unrelated panels, menu items with no command attached).

This version stores the roster as **data**, not code:

- `characters.py` — one entry per character (name, team, action set). Adding a
  character means adding one line here — nothing else to touch.
- `app.py` — a small Flask + Socket.IO server. It holds the single shared game
  state in memory and pushes updates to every connected browser (host + all
  phones) instantly whenever anything changes — no refreshing, no polling.
- `templates/host.html` + `static/host.js` — the full moderator console: round
  and phase strip, roster grouped by team, per-character health/protection/
  action controls, live vote tally, activity feed.
- `templates/player.html` + `static/player.js` — the phone view: current
  round/phase, active roster, and a vote button during Vote/Accuse phases.

## Bugs from the original fixed by this rebuild

1. **Desyncing toggle panels** — `villny_open()`, `heroix_open()`, `civl_open()`,
   `skix_open()` all shared one global counter (`q`), so opening/closing one
   panel could throw off the others' show/hide state. The web version gives
   each team its own independent expand/collapse state.
2. **Dead menu items** — "Dr. Silvana" and "Mad Hatter" had no `command=`
   attached in the villain menu, so clicking them did nothing.
3. **The phase toggle system** used the same fragile shared-counter pattern
   (`a, b, c, d, y, z` globals). Replaced with a single `phase_index` value.
4. **Every shielded character shared one global counter.** Superman, Flash,
   Green Lantern, Captain Marvel, Zatanna, Plastic Man, Booster Gold, Krypto,
   Streaky, Supergirl, Superboy, Wonder Girl, Miss Martian, Freddie Freeman,
   and Kendra Saunders all read and wrote the same `protxn_show` variable —
   using one character's shield affected what every other shielded character
   displayed. Each now has an independent charge count.
5. **Two of those shield buttons had no `command=` at all** in the original
   — Green Lantern's and Captain Marvel's shields were built but never wired
   up. Both are live here now.
6. **The health up/down math didn't count evenly** — clicking "up" while
   below max snapped straight to a fixed value instead of incrementing by
   one, in every character's code. Per your direction, this is now a clean
   +1/-1 counter clamped 0-4.

## What's modeled now (recovered from deeper in the original file)

- **Numeric health, not alive/down**, clamped 0-4, with per-team starting
  values pulled from the original's constants: Heroes start at 2 (Superman
  starts at 3 — his "must be targeted thrice" passive), Civilians and
  Sidekicks start at 1, Villains start at 1. Martians and Bystanders have no
  health track, matching the original.
- **Independent shield charges** for 15 characters (Superman, The Flash,
  Green Lantern, Captain Marvel, Zatanna, Plastic Man, Booster Gold, Krypto,
  Streaky, Supergirl, Superboy, Wonder Girl, Miss Martian, Freddie Freeman,
  Kendra Saunders), plus a "Recharge all shields +1" button (replicates a
  function in the original that bumped every shield at once).
- **Cure ability** — Leslie Thompkins, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Dr. Caitlin Snow.
- **Citizen's-arrest handcuffs** — James Gordon, Joe West, Maggie Sawyer.
- **Fix-it tech ability** — Harrison Wells, Felicity Smoak.
- **The DCEU location map** — an 11×7 coordinate grid (rows 0–10, columns
  R·O·Y·G·B·I·V) of 23 named DC locations (Batcave, Arkham Asylum,
  Watchtower, Gorilla City, etc.), opened from the host console's "Open map"
  button. Clicking any cell blacks out *every* cell sharing that location
  name at once, matching the original's behavior (several coordinates
  intentionally point to the same location).

## New: Win/Loss conditions — finalized

Replaced the earlier draft with your exact rules, tested individually
against a live import including the edge case (both conditions becoming
true at once correctly resolves as a Heroes win, not a loss):

**"White Martians Win!"**:
1. All active White Martians have been Rescued (reached Watchtower)
2. Martian Manhunter is Exposed
3. All active Heroes are Eliminated *before* all Civilians are Rescued
4. All active Civilians are Eliminated
5. All active Heroes reach Watchtower *before* all Civilians are Rescued
   (abandoning the mission early)

**"Heroes Win!"**:
1. All active White Martians are Exposed
2. All active Civilians have been Rescued

The ambiguous "-1 total Civilians" line is gone per your call, and the
earlier "all Heroes reach Watchtower = win" block is removed entirely —
it's now the opposite (a loss condition, #5 above), since sending Heroes
to safety before finishing the civilian rescues counts as abandoning the
mission.

Also fixed to match the newer, more authoritative "Phases of Play" doc:
the Discuss tutorial guide now says 2 minutes (not 5) and "you may not
nominate yourself" (the old doc said the opposite), and Vote's guide now
mentions Targeted-for-Teleportation and accusation immunity. One thing I
quietly dropped rather than guess about: the old doc's "toss a coin to
break a tie" line isn't in the new doc, so I removed it from the Vote
guide rather than state something no longer confirmed.

## New: "How to Play" phase guides for new players

At the start of every phase, through Round 3 only, players get a blue
tutorial toast (separate from the amber ability-reminder toast, so both
can show at once without colliding) explaining what to do:

- **Report, Discuss, Vote, Rescue** — the same guidance for everyone,
  cleaned up from your doc (e.g. Discuss explains the 5-minute window and
  the nominate-and-second rule; Vote explains the thumbs up/down and
  tie-breaking coin flip).
- **Accuse, Eliminate, Protect, Inspect** — only players *without* a
  matching tagged ability get a guide ("keep your eyes closed unless
  called on"). Anyone who *does* have a relevant ability already gets the
  specific ability text via the existing reminder toast, so they're not
  told the same thing twice.

After Round 3, these stop entirely, exactly as you asked — verified live
that Round 4 sends no guide at all.

**Two things worth your attention:**

1. **The Vote! phase mismatch.** Your doc describes voting as: one player
   gets nominated during Discuss, then *everyone* (including the nominee)
   votes thumbs up/down on sending just that one person to Watchtower. The
   app's actual digital voting still works differently — players pick from
   a list of active candidates, and the top vote-getter wins. I wrote the
   new guidance text to match your *real* rules, but the underlying
   mechanic hasn't changed, so what the guide tells players to expect and
   what the app actually does don't currently match. Want me to rebuild
   the Vote mechanic to work the way you've described here (nominate in
   Discuss, single-target thumbs up/down in Vote)?
2. **Added the moderator lines to Prompts.** The three bracketed narration
   cues in your doc ("This is Watchtower... Come in Justice League!",
   "Teleporter engaged, mind the flash," "There's a burst of light...")
   read like lines for you to read aloud, not player alerts — so I added
   them to the host's Prompts panel instead of building them as player
   pop-ups. Let me know if that's not what you meant.

## New: Win Condition — Heroes reach Watchtower

Confirmed Round 3 was correct — no change there. The moment every currently
active Hero has the Rescued condition, the game announces "HEROES WIN! All
Heroes have safely reached Watchtower" to the host and every player at
once, in a dramatic full-screen pop-up (players) and a persistent banner
with a one-click "Start New Game" button (host). Tested live: one hero
rescued doesn't trigger it, adding the second one does, and it correctly
never fires twice in the same game.

This is deliberately the *only* win/lose condition I built. The rules doc
also mentions a wrong-accusation loss condition and others — I only built
what you explicitly asked for here (all Heroes → Watchtower); let me know
if you want the others enforced too.

## New: animations throughout

- **Every modal now fades and scales in/out** instead of popping instantly
  — Prompts, the DCEU map, character cards, the hostage picker, phase
  scripts, the New Game dialog, all of it.
- **Locked characters slide/collapse away** when their pack isn't
  unlocked, instead of vanishing instantly — same for whole team sections
  when you collapse them.
- **Badges pop in** with a little bounce when a condition, Reveal, Draft,
  or Hostage status first appears on a row.
- **Toasts and banners slide down** from the top instead of snapping into
  place.

## New: vibrant host console

Gave the host console its own color identity without touching the
player side's Kirby look: a subtle cosmic gradient wash (purple, magenta,
amber) behind the whole page, a gradient-text brand title, gradient
buttons, a colored underline accent on every panel header, and each of
the 8 phase LEDs now has its own distinct idle color instead of uniform
gray. Kept it subtle enough that the roster (which has a lot of
information packed into it) stays easy to read — this wasn't a full
reskin, just enough color energy to feel like the same game as the player
side rather than a bare control panel.

## New: player-facing Conditions (Exposed / Eliminated / Rescued / Targeted)

Pressing the associated action button now does two things: it toggles a
real, persistent condition flag on that character (not just a log entry),
and privately pops up an alert on that player's phone with the exact rules
text, the moment it happens:

- **Expose → Exposed!** — "Everyone now knows which Hero, Villain, or
  Martian you are. You may no longer use your Active or Super Ability."
- **End/ELM → Eliminated!** — "You were successfully targeted by the White
  Martians without interference. You may no longer Discuss! or Vote!."
- **Watchtower → Rescued!** — the full safety-zone text, including losing
  Passive/Active/Super ability access.
- **Teleport → Targeted!** — the "chosen during Discuss or Eliminate" text.

Conditions **stack** — a character can be Exposed *and* Targeted at once,
and both show as separate badges on their host row. **At the start of
every new round**, any player with one or more active conditions gets a
recap pop-up listing everything still in effect, exactly as you asked.
Clicking Deactivate clears all of a character's conditions along with
taking them off the board. These flags are purely informational/alerting
for now — see below for what I deliberately didn't build yet.

**Resolved:** Round 3 confirmed correct (see the new Win Condition section
below), and the "all Heroes reach Watchtower" win condition is now built.

**Still open:** the rest of the rules doc's enforcement — Active Ability
once per round, Super Ability once per game total, the exemptions
(Passive/Active use never causes Expose), team-specific asymmetries (a
Rescued Villain only loses their Active Ability, not Passive/Super; an
Exposed Martian has no penalty), and the wrong-accusation loss condition.
None of that is built yet — just the four conditions, their alerts, and
the one win condition. Say the word whenever you want it.

## New: full Hostage mechanic (real-world reveal-to-save)

Built out properly per your spec: a villain targets one active character
and takes them hostage. Their card's named counterpart hero then has 10
real-world seconds to stand up and declare their identity ("I am Batman!")
or the hostage loses 1 health. This covers three shapes, all driven
directly by each character's `hostage_counterpart` data:

- **One specific named hero** — Tobias Whale (Black Lightning), Reverse
  Flash & Zoom (The Flash), Sinestro (Green Lantern), Black Adam (Captain
  Marvel)
- **Any hero in a category** — Faora and Reign ("any Kryptonian" — the
  banner lists whichever Kryptonian heroes are currently active)
- **No counterpart at all** — Two-Face's "Let Fate Decide" keeps its
  original free-choice-of-two-targets, coin-flip-flavored version, since
  his card doesn't name a specific hero who can save anyone

None of these (except Two-Face and Two-Face-only) require a reveal first —
Tobias Whale, Reverse Flash, Zoom, Sinestro, Black Adam, and Faora are
already their true selves from the start, so their Take Hostage button
works as soon as they're active. Only Two-Face and Reign (both disguised
civilians) need their Reveal button clicked first.

When a hostage is taken, a persistent banner appears at the top of the
host console — not just a toast that disappears — showing who needs to
reveal and who's on the line, with two buttons: **✅ Revealed — Release**
(no penalty) or **❌ Time's Up — Lose 1 HP** (reduces the hostage's health
by one, same as any other health change). The banner stays up until you
resolve it, so it survives you navigating around the console.

## Card content updates (round 6 of your corrections) — original 15 complete

**Thunder** now has her real content, and with her, **all 15 characters
from the original "-ICE" typo list are fully done.** Her "Hologram"
ability adds another data point for the hostage system: she can lie during
a hostage situation involving Black Lightning specifically — pairing with
Tobias Whale's ability to take him hostage in the first place.

**6 characters remain marked Draft across the whole roster** (from the
broader audit, separate from the original 15): Alfred Pennyworth, Cheetah,
Gorilla Grodd, Joker, Maggie Sawyer, Swamp Thing.

## Card content updates (round 5 of your corrections)

**Harrison Wells** now has his real content — confirmed as the gender-swap
counterpart of Felicity Smoak, sharing her exact "I Can Fix That" active
ability, plus his own "Know-It-All" passive. Cleared from Draft. Only
**Thunder** remains from the original 15.

## Card content updates (round 4 of your corrections)

**Maxima** got a full rewrite (her old "-ICE" passive is replaced entirely
with two new real passives: "Never Give Up" and "Interplanetary
Obsession"). **Granny Goodness** now has real content and is cleared from
Draft — only **Harrison Wells** and **Thunder** remain from the original
15.

New mechanic spotted, unrelated to hostage-taking: Granny's "Female Fury"
converts up to 3 targeted players into a new "Fury" status, and "Granny
Says" lets her issue a Fury a binding verbal command. Tracking this
alongside the hostage variants for whenever we design the non-card
mechanics.

## Card content updates (round 3 of your corrections)

**Perry White** now has his real content — confirmed as a gender-swap
counterpart of Cat Grant, sharing the same "I'm in Charge" passive and
"Taking One for the Team" active, as you flagged. Cleared from Draft.
Both remain fully independent characters with their own state; sharing
ability text causes no conflicts.

## Card content updates (round 2 of your corrections)

Updated with real content: **Zoom, Faora, Dr. Alchemy, Felicity Smoak,
Ares**. Faora, Dr. Alchemy, and Ares now have genuine Super Abilities. All
five cleared from the Draft badge.

More hostage-pattern variations showing up here, for when we design the
real system: Zoom targets The Flash specifically (same as round 1's
named-hero pattern), but **Faora's targets "any Kryptonian"** — a
*category* of characters rather than one fixed name. That's a third
distinct shape for this mechanic (Two-Face: any two of your choice;
Tobias Whale/Reverse Flash/Sinestro/Black Adam/Zoom: one specific named
hero; Faora: any character matching a category). Still holding off on
building this out until you've sent everything.

## Card content updates (round 1 of your corrections)

Updated with real content from the source you provided: **Tobias Whale,
Reverse Flash, Zod, Sinestro, Black Adam**. Zod, Sinestro, and Black Adam
now have genuine Super Abilities (they'll correctly trigger the Round 3
badge and unlock pop-up); all five are cleared from the Draft badge list.

**A pattern worth flagging before you send more cards**: several villains
now have an ability like *"Player takes target hostage (Black Lightning)"*
— a single, specific named hero, not "pick any active character." This is
a different mechanic than Two-Face's "Let Fate Decide" (which lets him
pick any two targets freely). I haven't built anything for this yet since
I'd rather see the full pattern across all your corrections before
designing the UI for it — let me know once you've sent everything and I'll
figure out the right general "hostage" system that covers both cases.

**Also fixed while reviewing this**: the phase-tag parser (the thing that
powers the gold spotlight glow and player phase-reminders) only recognized
tags directly after an opening parenthesis, like `(Accuse!)`. Reverse
Flash's "Not So Fast" ability uses `(start/Rescue!)`, which slipped through
undetected. Fixed to catch tags after a `/` too — confirmed it now picks
up Rescue for that ability without breaking any of the existing ones.

## New: fixed "-ICE" typo, added a Draft badge

Fixed a copy-paste bug from the original file: 15 characters' passive
ability read "Player must be targeted -ICE for elimination" — now
correctly "twice." The likely cause: Superman's finished ability ("must be
targeted **thrice**") was clearly copy-pasted as a starting template for
other characters, and a bulk find-and-replace swapping "thrice" for
"twice" chopped off the front of the word, leaving only "-ICE" behind.

Since 14 of those 15 characters also have other unfinished placeholder
text on the same card, a fixed typo alone doesn't mean the card is done —
so every character with any remaining placeholder content (the generic
"Name. Description. (Phase!)" stand-in, or the "SUPER" → "XER ABILITY"
typo) now shows a dashed "📝 Draft" badge on the host console, next to
their name, so it's easy to spot at a glance which cards still need real
writing.

**The 15 characters with the -ICE typo** (now fixed):
- Reverse Flash
- Tobias Whale
- Zod
- Sinestro
- Black Adam
- Zoom
- Faora
- Dr. Alchemy
- Ares
- Maxima
- Granny Goodness
- Perry White
- Harrison Wells
- Felicity Smoak
- Thunder

Of these, all but **Maxima** still show the Draft badge, since they have
other unfinished content beyond the typo. The full set of 20 characters
currently marked Draft: those 14, plus Alfred Pennyworth, Cheetah, Gorilla
Grodd, Joker, Maggie Sawyer, and Swamp Thing.

## New: Hostage mechanic (Two-Face's Let Fate Decide)

Once Harvey Dent is revealed as Two-Face, a **Take Hostage** button appears
on his row (Two-Face-colored, split blue/orange — disabled and grayed out
until he's revealed). Clicking it opens "Let Fate Decide": pick exactly two
currently-active characters, optionally flip a coin for flavor, then
confirm — this marks both targets with a 🔗 Hostage badge and starts a
10-second timer on the host screen. Click a Hostage badge on any row to
release that character. Resolving what the hostage-taking actually leads to
(elimination, rescue, whatever fits the moment) is left to your normal
action buttons, same as the original design's intent — I didn't try to
mechanically enforce an outcome since the source material didn't specify
one beyond "fate decides."

## New: Super Abilities activate at Round 3

Starting Round 3, every active character with a real (non-placeholder)
Super Ability gets a gold "⭐ Super Active" badge on the host roster, and
the player behind that character gets a one-time pop-up the moment Round 3
begins, showing their character's name and the full Super Ability text.
This only fires once per game and only for abilities that have real
content — none of the 20 characters with unfinished placeholder text
(flagged earlier) will trigger it.

## New: Report! script wording

The scanner line now reads "Scanners indicate at least N White Martian(s)
among you" with correct singular/plural ("1 White Martian" vs "2 White
Martians") instead of just a bare number.

## New: Clear All button

Next to the Roster panel header, "Clear All" deactivates every currently
active character in one click (with a confirmation prompt) — handy for
resetting the board between rounds without hunting down every toggle.

## New: the Switch mechanic (secret civilian identities)

Seven characters now genuinely start the game disguised as an ordinary
civilian and only become their true selves when you reveal them:

| Starts as (Civilian) | Reveals as | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| Mary Batson | Mary Marvel | Shield |
| Freddie Freeman | Cpt. Marvel, Jr. | Shield |
| Kendra Saunders | Hawkwoman | Shield |
| Harvey Dent | Two-Face | — |
| Dr. Harleen Quinzel | Harley Quinn | — |
| Dr. Caitlin Snow | Killer Frost | — |
| Samantha Arias | Reign | — |

**On the host console**, each of these seven shows a small purple 🎭 badge
next to their civilian name at all times, so you always know their secret
identity even before revealing it — the badge is host-only. A **Reveal**
button on their row flips them (and can be clicked again to un-reveal if
you hit it by mistake). The three with a shield show a 🔒 lock icon instead
of a charge count until revealed, since their card ties the shield to a
Hero-only ability — clicking Reveal unlocks it automatically.

**Everywhere else, the name updates live the moment you reveal someone**:
their roster row, the player's "My Card" title, their "You are ___" banner
(they get a fresh reveal pop-up, same as the initial shuffle reveal), the
"Active on the Board" list other players see, and even next round's Report
recap if they were rescued or eliminated that round.

**Ability filtering is real, not cosmetic.** Their card text already tagged
each ability with which state it belongs to (e.g. "*Type: Civilian only,"
"**Type: Hero only") — I use those exact tags now. Before reveal, a player
opening "My Card" only sees Civilian-tagged and untagged abilities; the
Hero/Villain-only ones are invisible until you reveal them. The host's own
card view always shows everything, tags and all, since you need full
information regardless of what's been revealed.

One honest gap: Samantha Arias/Reign's card was never finished in the
original file (placeholder ability text), so revealing her only changes
her name and unlocks nothing extra — there's no real Hero/Villain-tagged
ability to filter in or out for her. Harvey Dent, Harleen Quinzel, and
Caitlin Snow's post-reveal abilities (a "hostage"-style mechanic in the
original) are shown as text on their card but don't have a dedicated
button/counter built for them yet, the way shields do — the original
implementation of that particular mechanic was itself inconsistent in the
source file (it reused other characters' UI elements in confusing ways),
so I left it as informational text rather than guess at a UI for it. Let
me know if you want that built out properly too.

## New: five host/player refinements

1. **Player's "Active on the Board" list is now names only** — no health,
   no shield, nothing about what a character can do. Players can see
   what's in play, not what it's capable of.
2. **Character-count enforcement once the roster is locked.** Locking with
   more active characters than players pops a warning telling you exactly
   how many to deactivate. After locking, trying to activate a character
   beyond the player count is blocked outright with an explanation —
   enforced server-side, not just a UI restriction.
3. **White Martian card added.** You found the actual source — it turns out
   my search missed it because the original function was named `mart_stats`
   rather than containing the word "martian" anywhere, which is exactly
   what I searched for. Both White Martian slots now show: Passive —
   Shapeshifter (acts as Civilian/Bystander until Exposed), Active —
   Telepathic Attack (Eliminate!), and Super — Mind Merge (Discuss!, with
   the Martian Manhunter win condition). Since Mind Merge and Telepathic
   Attack are tagged to Discuss and Eliminate respectively, White Martians
   now also correctly trigger the phase-reminder toast (player side) and
   the gold spotlight glow (host side) during those phases, automatically
   — no extra code needed since both features already read these tags off
   the card.
4. **End → ELM.** Purely a label change (short for "Eliminated") — the
   underlying action, tooltip, and tracking are unchanged.
5. **Phase-relevant characters now spotlight** — a pulsing gold glow
   around any active character whose card has an ability tagged for the
   phase currently selected (the same tagging system that powers player
   phase reminders). Superman lights up during Protect and Accuse, for
   instance, since his card has abilities tied to both.

## New: player-facing voting redesign

Three changes to how players vote, all tested live:

1. **Players see real player names during Vote, never character names.**
   The vote list is now a flat list of real names — completely decorrelated
   from character identity, not just hidden in the UI. Even opening browser
   dev tools during Vote phase won't reveal who's playing whom; the payload
   sent to players literally contains no character IDs alongside the names.
2. **One vote only, enforced by the server** — not just the UI. Once a vote
   is recorded, the server rejects any further vote from that player, so
   refreshing the page or replaying the request can't change it.
3. **A confirmation step before submitting.** Tapping a name shows "Vote for
   X?" with Confirm/Cancel buttons; nothing is sent to the server until
   Confirm is tapped. After that, the list locks and shows "Vote locked in
   for X."

Accuse no longer accepts app-based votes (previously it shared the voting
window with Vote phase) — it now has its own distinct narration line only,
matching how you'd described it as a separate spoken-accusation step. Say
the word if you actually wanted digital voting there too.

**A bug I found and fixed while building this**: three buttons whose click
handler needed to reference a player's name — the Players panel's
click-to-eliminate, the New Game dialog's remove-player button, and (before
today) nothing on the vote list — were vulnerable to breaking on names
containing certain characters, because the name was being inserted directly
into an HTML `onclick="..."` attribute. It happened to work in every test
so far only because the names used didn't trigger it. All three now use a
safer pattern that isn't sensitive to what characters appear in a name.

## New: manage players when starting a new game

Clicking **New game** now opens a "Start New Game" dialog instead of
immediately resetting everything:

- **Remove** any individual player with the ✕ next to their name
- **Remove All Players** to clear the roster entirely
- **Add a player by name** — useful for someone joining in person without
  needing to register from their own phone first
- Removals/additions apply live as soon as you make them, so you can leave
  the dialog open and adjust things as people arrive or drop out
- **Start New Game** performs the actual reset (round, board, packs, all
  character assignments) while keeping whichever players are listed in the
  dialog at that moment — nothing auto-repopulates from who's currently
  connected anymore, so the roster is exactly what you set it to.

## New: epithet hover text

Hovering a character's name now shows their well-known comics epithet
("Superman" → "The Man of Steel") instead of the generic "View character
card" tooltip — but only for the 56 characters that actually have a
widely-recognized nickname. Everyone else (Vibe, Booster Gold, most
civilians and sidekicks, several lesser-known villains) keeps the default
"View character card" tooltip rather than a made-up one. The full list of
who has what is in `EPITHETS` at the top of `characters.py` if you want to
add, remove, or correct any.

## New: small usability fixes

1. **Heart icon on health** — matches the existing shield icon pattern (❤️3).
2. **Hover tooltips** — every button on the host console shows a short
   definition on hover: End = "Eliminate character," Watchtower = "Mark
   rescued," Hive = "Starro minion," Teleport = "To Be Teleported," and
   Expose = "No More Secret ID."
3. **Roster is now vertically scrollable** with its own scrollbar, so a
   long unlocked roster doesn't push the rest of the page down.
4. **Vote phase has its own 2-minute timer**, same pattern as Discuss — a
   "Start 2-minute timer" button inside the Vote phase script popup.
5. **Locked characters are now fully hidden**, not just dimmed — if a
   pack isn't unlocked, its characters don't appear in the roster at all.
   Team headers still show a live count of only the currently-visible
   (unlocked) characters, and a team with nothing unlocked yet shows a
   small "no characters unlocked in this team yet" note instead of an
   empty box.

## New: Roster starts collapsed

The roster's team sections are now collapsed by default the moment the host
console loads, and collapse again automatically every time you click "New
game" — no more scrolling past an expanded roster you haven't set up yet.

## New: Phase scripts (what Watchtower says aloud)

Selecting any phase now pops up a card showing exactly what the moderator
should say, filled in live from the current game state:

- **Report** — Round 1 (or any round with no tracked history) shows the
  mission-briefing line, listing active Heroes, Civilians, and Villains by
  character name, plus the number of active Martians. From Round 2 on, it
  automatically switches to a **recap of the previous round** instead —
  who was safely beamed to Watchtower and who didn't survive — built from
  what you clicked during that round (see below).
- **Discuss** — the fixed line, plus a "Start 2-minute timer" button that
  launches the countdown for you. I changed the Discuss timer's default
  from 5 minutes to 2 to match this new script's exact wording — let me
  know if 5 was actually intentional and I'll change it back.
- **Vote** — updates live as votes come in: the nomination line always
  lists every currently-active player's real name, and the second line
  fills in the current leading vote-getter's real name once votes start
  arriving (before that, it says "waiting for votes").
- **Accuse** — the fixed line, no placeholders.
- **Rescue** — uses whoever won the Vote phase (captured the moment you
  leave Vote, so it's still correct even though votes clear right after).

A couple of interpretation calls I made, worth confirming:
- **Report's lists use character names** (Superman, Lois Lane, Joker), since
  that's Oracle's in-fiction, all-knowing narration. **Vote and Rescue use
  real player names**, since "raise your hand" and "keep still" are
  addressed to actual people at the table. If that split isn't what you
  meant, it's a quick change.
- **Vote's "nominated players"** currently means *everyone still active* —
  there's no separate nomination step in the app yet, so it lists the full
  pool of people still in play rather than a host-picked subset.

## New: round-outcome tracking for the Report recap

Yes, this was possible — here's how it works. Clicking a character's
**Watchtower** action marks them "rescued" for the round; clicking **End**
marks them "eliminated." When you advance the round counter, whatever got
tracked during the round you're leaving is archived, and the next Report
phase opened for a later round automatically pulls from it. No manual
data entry — just use the action buttons as you normally would during
Rescue/Eliminate phases, and the recap writes itself.

## New: Card Packs

A **Card Packs** bar now sits at the top of the host console, one chip per
pack from your set list. **Basic** is always on (green, non-clickable) since
those characters are free. Every other pack starts locked (dim) — click a
chip to unlock it live, and every character in that pack immediately becomes
selectable in the roster below, tagged with its pack name next to its name
(e.g. "Batman — Hall of Justice"). Click the chip again to lock the pack
back up — any of its characters that were active get automatically
deactivated and cleared so the roster never shows something from a
relocked pack.

Locked characters still show up in the roster (dimmed, with a 🔒), so you
can preview what a pack contains, but every control on that row — the
toggle, health, shields, actions — is inert until its pack is unlocked. You
can still click a locked character's name to preview their ability card.

A few notes on how your set list mapped onto the existing roster:

- **Renamed to match your set list** (the underlying data/cards are
  unaffected): Captain Marvel → **Shazam!**, Martha Kent → **Ma Kent**,
  Jonathan Kent → **Pa Kent**, A. Pennyworth → **Alfred Pennyworth**, Grodd →
  **Gorilla Grodd**.
- **Two brand-new characters added** since they weren't in the original
  game at all: **Ma'alefa'k** (Interstellar Threats) and **Reign** (Civil
  Disobedience). Both work fully in the tracker, but since they never
  existed in the original file, they have no ability card yet — "My Card"
  will show "no card on file" for them until you write one into `cards.json`.
- **Removed**: Dr. Silvana and Mad Hatter. Both were already dead menu items
  in the original file (no working command, no ability card) and weren't in
  any pack on your list, so I retired them rather than leave permanently
  unreachable characters in the roster.
- **Bystanders expanded from 3 to 6** to cover the counts your list needs
  across Hostage Situation (1), Young Justice (2), and Agents of Chaos (3).
- **Power Struggle** is listed as "7 cards (5-V, 1-H)" but the bullet list
  itself has 7 named characters (6 villains + 1 hero) plus a "???" — I built
  the 7 named ones (Ares, Vandal Savage, Maxima, Ra's Al-Ghul, Roulette,
  Riddler, Booster Gold) and left the "???" out since there's no way to build
  a real card from a placeholder. Worth double-checking this pack's exact
  intended contents against your records.
- **Six existing characters aren't in any pack on your list**: Vibe, Swamp
  Thing, Brainiac, Poison Ivy, Harrison Wells, and Felicity Smoak. They're
  still in the roster but permanently locked with no pack to unlock — there's
  no chip that turns them on. Let me know which pack they belong in (or if
  you want a new pack for them) and I'll wire it up.

## New: Kirby Krackle player cards

The player-facing cards — the shuffle reveal ("You are SUPERMAN!"), My Card,
and Rules & Phases — now have a hand-built Kirby Krackle border: clustered
black dot bursts at each corner plus a scattered dot texture along the
frame, over a bold cosmic purple-to-orange gradient reminiscent of Kirby's
Fourth World energy effects. Card titles, the reveal name, and the phase
banner use "Bangers," a bold comic-book display font, in place of the
sci-fi HUD font used on the host console, so the player experience reads
more like a Silver Age comic panel.

I couldn't open the private Google Drive reference image you linked (it
returned an access error), so this is built from the well-known Kirby
Krackle style rather than that specific reference — let me know if it needs
adjusting once you see it. This pass covers the player side only, per how
you'd scoped the work; happy to extend the same treatment further (e.g.
halftone textures, bolder host-side accents) if you want more of it.

## New: Prompts button (moderator narration)

A **Prompts** button in the host console's top bar opens a reference of
narration scripts — how to declare eliminations, transports, ability use,
etc. — pulled directly from what you gave me. One entry, "Wonder Woman
discovers White Martians," is shown struck through and tagged "no longer
used" since you'd crossed it out — I kept it visible rather than deleting
it in case you want it back, but it won't be mistaken for current.

There's also a placeholder **Intro Script** at the top of that same panel —
no intro text was included in what you sent, so it currently just says to
fill it in. Edit `INTRO_SCRIPT` in `characters.py` with your actual opening
narration whenever you're ready.

## New: Players panel, Start, and Shuffle

The host console now has a **Players** panel on the right, listing everyone
who's joined from `/play`, numbered in join order. Click a name to cross it
out (green = alive, red strikethrough = eliminated) — this is a manual
toggle for you to track eliminations, independent of any character's health.

- **Start** locks the roster: once clicked, players who join later won't be
  added to the list or be eligible for Shuffle (they can still connect, they
  just won't be dealt a character). Use this once everyone's phone is in.
- **Shuffle** (enabled after Start) randomly assigns one character to each
  locked-in player, using only the characters you've toggled *active* on
  the roster — so if you've turned on Superman, White Martian I, and Lois
  Lane, those are the only three that can be dealt out. If you have more
  players than active characters, it tells you instead of guessing.
- Reshuffling is allowed (e.g. before the game really starts) — each
  shuffle clears old assignments on active characters first, then deals
  fresh ones.

## New: what players see after Shuffle

- **A reveal card** pops up automatically on each player's phone: "You are
  SUPERMAN!" with a button to view their full card immediately.
- **My Card** — a toolbar button always available once a player's joined,
  showing *only their own* character's signal, role, abilities, and
  strategy (fetched privately from the server; nobody else's card is ever
  sent to them).
- **Rules & Phases** — a toolbar button with a plain-language reference for
  what each of the 8 phases means (these are inferred placeholder
  descriptions — worth editing `PHASE_INFO` in `characters.py` to match your
  actual rules exactly).
- **Phase reminders** — when the host advances to a phase, any player whose
  character has an ability tagged for that phase (parsed from the original
  ability text's own "(Protect!)", "(Accuse!)", etc. tags) gets a private
  toast reminding them of it. Superman gets nudged during Accuse and
  Protect; a civilian with no phase-tagged ability gets nothing.

## New: player identity privacy

Player phones no longer receive the name-to-character mapping at all — the
server strips it out of everything sent to `/play` clients. Each player only
learns their own assignment: after typing their name on the name-gate
screen, they get a private "You are Superman"-style banner that nobody
else's phone (or network traffic) can see. The host console still sees the
full mapping for every character, since that's needed to run the game.

## New: Discuss! timer

Clicking the **Discuss** phase LED on the host console now pops up a 5-minute
countdown timer automatically. It has Pause/Resume, Reset (back to 5:00),
and +1 minute controls, plays a short beep when it hits zero, and can be
reopened any time from the "Discuss! timer" button in the side panel if you
close it early. This lives only on the host's screen — it's not synced to
player phones.

## Scope note

The ability rulebook text embedded in the original is now surfaced in the
app after all — **click any character's name** on the host console to open
their card: signal, role, passive/active/super abilities, and strategy tip,
pulled straight from the original file's 85 character-stats popups.

Three things worth knowing about that data:
- **Martians, Bystanders, Dr. Silvana, and Mad Hatter have no card** — the
  first two never had one in the original, and the latter two were the dead
  menu items from bug #2 above, so no ability text exists for them anywhere
  in the source file. Their card just says "no card on file."
- **Joker's third ability is a literal placeholder** in the original file —
  its text is `"SUPER ABILITY. Name. Description. (Phase!)"`, word for word.
  Looks like it was never finished. I didn't invent content to fill it in;
  worth writing a real one in for your next game.
- A few character names in the card popups differ slightly from the roster
  list (e.g. Krypto's card title is "Krypto the Superdog," Zod's is "General
  Zod"), matched up correctly behind the scenes either way.

## New capability (not in the original — flagging since it's a scope change)

The original was moderator-only with no player input at all. Since you asked
for players to "view/vote from their phones," I added a lightweight vote
button during the **Vote** and **Accuse** phases, tallied live on the host
screen. If that's not what you had in mind — e.g. you just want players
watching a read-only board while voting happens out loud — say the word and
I'll strip it down to view-only.

## Extending it

- To add/rename a character: edit `characters.py`.
- To change rounds/phases: edit `PHASES` / `NUM_ROUNDS` at the bottom of
  `characters.py`.
- To add a new per-character action button: add its name to
  `STANDARD_ACTIONS` in `characters.py` — it appears on every character
  automatically.
