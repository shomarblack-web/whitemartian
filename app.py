"""
White Martian - Watchtower
A live, multi-device game tracker for the host's Mafia/Werewolf variant.

Run:  python app.py
Host device:   http://localhost:5000/host
Player phones: http://<host-machine-LAN-IP>:5000/play   (same WiFi)

Architecture:
- One process holds the single source of truth (GAME state, below).
- The host page can change anything. Player pages are read-mostly + can cast a vote.
- Every change is broadcast over Socket.IO to every connected browser, so the
  host's laptop and every player's phone always show the same live state.
  No page-refresh, no polling.
- Privacy: the host console needs to see which real player is playing which
  character. Player phones must NOT see that mapping for anyone but
  themselves - Joe should learn he's Superman without learning who's playing
  Batman. So two different payloads go out on every change: hosts (room
  "hosts") get the full state including every player_name; players (room
  "players") get a stripped copy with player_name removed. Each registered
  player also privately gets a "whoami_result" telling them only their own
  character(s), computed server-side and sent to their socket id alone.
